# Public Data Scripts

Plain Node.js `.mjs` scripts for the v0.2.0 public-data automation scaffold.

- `validate-source-registry.mjs` validates planned source placeholders and confirms no active or real-ingested public data source is configured.
- `generate-refresh-report.mjs` writes a deterministic readiness report without fetching external data or changing app-visible data.

Run from `statterrain/`:

```bash
npm run data:validate-sources
npm run data:refresh-report
```

## v0.2.2 CMS hospital baseline pilot

v0.2.2 adds the first real public-data ingestion pilot for CMS Hospital General Information, the top hospital source identified in the v0.2.1 benchmark. The pull script reads the benchmark, resolves the CMS dataset endpoint when the benchmark download URL is still `TBD`, writes raw snapshot metadata, and either normalizes/generates CMS hospital records or records a fetch-failed refresh report without creating fake records.

The current run in this environment was fetch-blocked, so no generated CMS hospital records were published. Reports are stored in `data/reports/cms-hospitals-validation-v0.2.2.json` and `data/reports/cms-hospitals-refresh-v0.2.2.json`; raw metadata is stored in `data/raw/cms-hospitals/cms-hospitals-raw-metadata-v0.2.2.json`. If a connected environment fetch succeeds, normalized output goes to `data/normalized/cms-hospitals/cms-hospitals-normalized-v0.2.2.json`, generated output goes to `data/generated/cms-hospitals.generated.json`, and passing validation updates `data/last-known-good/cms-hospitals.generated.json`.

The main app remains synthetic by default and the CMS pilot does not power the main map. Coordinates may be missing because geocoding is explicitly deferred to v0.2.3. Emergency-services and critical-access labels are source-supported only. No patient-level data, claims data, PHI, live routing/diversion/bed status, or clinical decision support is added. The next patch should be v0.2.3 Facility Geocoding and Geography Join.
